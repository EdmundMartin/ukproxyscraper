# ukproxyscraper
Scrapes proxies from a variety of different sites and returns in a format suitable for use with Python's request library.

Currently, gatherproxy and freeproxy list are supported allowing users to easily grab the free UK proxies availiable on both of these portals. I plan to add support for additional sites to allow for the scraping of a larger set of IP's.

## Grabbing Proxies
Each of the supported sites have their own method for grabbing proxies from the particular site in question. This allows users to only grab proxies from sites they trust the most. This is done as in the above example.
